## Introduction
The dataset was given as a project in order to test students on the work taught in the past three months. We employed the use of the apps taught to us to bring forth an explorative analysis of a business for their sales and customer data. The project draws it's many results from various classes and personal practice. 

## Tools Used
- Microsoft excel [Download here](https://www.microsoft.com)
- Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio [Download Here](https://aka.ms/ssmsfullsetup)
- Microsoft Power BI [Donwload here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=58494)

  ## Data Transformation and loading
  The raw data was filled with various flaws that had to be cleaned out first with Ms Excel then put into the SQL studio to extract more information and finally transformed to a visualization in Ms Power BI.

## Insight of the data 
The data given was not business specified, however, the name give to this company will be **CAPSTONE**. Capstone seems to have encountered an issue in trying to understand their company sales and want to openly summarize their sale of items (gloves, shirt, shoes, socks, hats and jackets) on the other hand, their monthly subscription agency wants to further understand their customers on the basis of their subsciption types (basic, standard and premium). The questions asked provide a knowledge of what the company is looking for. For the first data, it has the tag of SALES DATA while the second is tagged CUSTOMER DATA. As stated earlier, the use of all three tools made sure to stretch across all questions that both the comany and the analyst had.    
   
The first data (SALES DATA) had several questions like, their total sales (which was extracted with multiplying the quantity sold and the unit price), the average of each product (to show which product had the highest average outside the general average), the region that had more sales (which used a pivot table to spread it out properly) and so on. The images help explain them further.

From the image above it is quiet evident that CAPSTONE has its biggest consumers in the South while having their lowest concumers in the west. This flat out points that various strategies like advertising and express marketing are to be applied. In the same image, we see that the average for the products differ quite heavily. The highest average being shirt and the lowest being socks (to be honest, it lies with the fact that there needs to be a study on the consumers today; many aren't interested in wearing socks anymore)

The tables above are pivot tables giving more insight on the above table. The additional point is just the inclusion of Customer ID.

Other images for this particular table, include the following;

All questions have been duly answered to their capacity.

The second table tagged CUSTOMER DATA had questions that bugged CAPSTONE. Their subscription rate was either on a decline or on an incline. So they got curios about the customer and their subscriptions in the packages provided by them. Of course the data intends to show the exact reports that the company wants and needs. Some of the questions asked were; the most popular subscription type (to measure out which of CAPSTONE's subscription packages was appealing to most buyers), the year that brought more profits (to see the timeline of trends and follow the pattern), regions and their revenues (tgo measure which region is the most successful out of all the four) and so on. The following images will help explain further.

The excel image above tells of CAPSTONE's biggest concerns. Clearly they plan on trying to decipher where their goods are wanted and what kind of things they put out. According to the report, the most popular subscription type happens to be **basic**. Main reason it falls on here can be due to the expences that are to be paid. Many don't want to pay for something that they may not use everyday and would rather get the cheaper version and use it once in a while. From this angle they can look into planning packages for several demographics i.e. families, students, job holders, teenagers and maybe the youths. If you look at the revenue aspect, generally, CAPSTONE is a stable company but it seems that some part of the country doesn't meet the quota of revenue. Many may presume that the company isn't going to suffer anything due to the slight difference but knowing this kind of issue is more convinient than meeting in a courtroom. They can amp up the advertisment for this sector to showcase their subscription. The use of influencers can also give it a large boost in revenue. Fianlly, from this table, trhe average of the duration lasts till a whiole year and some days. This means that many are willing to hold their subscription plan till a whole year is over. Loyalty is needed for consumer-producer relationships to work.

The piveot tables above explain this further.

Here are some others that could be used to explain it further;

## Recommendation and Conclusion
From the above data, it is clear that CAPSTONE needs to work vehemently on the use of trends to bring up their sales and revenue. When a company aligns themselves with the present world, technology and all, they tend to gain more than loose. As stated earlier, the use of influencers can greatly help. When the masses sees a person of a model figure using such product, most will drain their pockets till they buy every last drop. Years chang, but trends are repetitive, follow the patterns of each year can also help.
