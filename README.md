## Introduction
The dataset was given as a project in order to test students on the work taught in the past three months. We employed the use of the apps taught to us to bring forth an explorative analysis of a business for their sales and customer data. The project draws it's many results from various classes and personal practice. 

## Tools Used
- Microsoft excel [Download here](https://www.microsoft.com)
- Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio [Download Here](https://aka.ms/ssmsfullsetup)
- Microsoft Power BI [Donwload here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=58494)

  ## Data Transformation and loading
  The raw data was filled with various flaws that had to be cleaned out first with Ms Excel then put into the SQL studio to extract more information and finally transformed to a visualization in Ms Power BI.

## Insight of the data 
The data given was not business specified, however, the name give to this company will be **CAPSTONE**. Capstone seems to have encountered an issue in trying to understand their company sales and want to openly summarize their sale of items (gloves, shirt, socks, hats and jackets) on the other hand, their monthly subscription agency wants to further understand their customers on the basis of their subsciption types (basic, standard and premium). The questions asked provide a knowledge of what the company is looking for. For the first data, it has the tag of SALES DATA while the second is tagged CUSTOMER DATA. As stated earlier, the use of all three tools made sure to stretch across all questions that both the comany and the analyst had.    
    The first data (SALES DATA) had several questions like, their total sales (which was extracted with multiplying the quantity sold and the unit price), the average of each product (to show which product had the highest average outside the general average), the region that had more sales (which used a pivot table to spread it out properly) and so on. The images help explain them further.

From the image above it is quiet evident that CAPSTONE has its biggest consumers in the South while having their lowest concumers in the west. This flat out points that various strategies like advertising and express marketing are to be applied. In the same image, we see that the average for the products differ quite heavily. The highest average being shirt and the lowest being socks (to be honest, it lies with the fact that there needs to be a study on the consumers today; many aren't interested in wearing socks anymore)

The tables above are pivot tables giving more insight on the above table. The additional point is just the inclusion of Customer ID.
